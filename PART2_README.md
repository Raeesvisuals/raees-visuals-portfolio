## 📝 Notes

### Placeholders
All video and image paths currently use placeholders:
- `/placeholders/*.mp4` - Video files
- `/placeholders/*.jpg` - Thumbnail images

These will be replaced with real content later.

### Video Modal
The modal currently shows a placeholder. To add real videos:
1. Uncomment the `<video>` tag in `VideoModal.tsx`
2. Add your video files to `public/placeholders/`
3. Update paths in `data/portfolio.ts`

### Performance
- Three.js canvas is optimized for 60fps
- Images/videos should be lazy-loaded (add in production)
- Consider using Next.js Image component for thumbnails
